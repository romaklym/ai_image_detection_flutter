# AI vs Human Image Detector

A Flutter mobile application that uses machine learning to detect whether an image was generated by AI or created by humans. The app features a clean, professional interface and connects to a Python FastAPI backend for image classification.

## Features

- 🖼️ **Image Upload**: Select images from your device gallery
- 🤖 **AI Detection**: Determine if an image is AI-generated or human-created
- 📊 **Confidence Scoring**: View confidence percentage for predictions
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with smooth animations
- ⚡ **Real-time Analysis**: Fast image processing and results

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Flutter mobile app with Material Design
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI server with Hugging Face Transformers
- **Model**: `Ateeqq/ai-vs-human-image-detector` from Hugging Face

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.10.0 or higher)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- iOS/Android development environment

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Navigate to the folder containing `server.py` and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn torch torchvision torchaudio transformers pillow
```

### 2. Get Your Local IP Address

Find your machine's local IP address:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```

Example output: `192.168.1.100`

### 3. Start the Backend Server

Run the FastAPI server with your local IP:

```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload --host 192.168.1.100 --port 8000
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with your actual IP address. Keep this terminal running.

### 4. Configure the Flutter App

Update the endpoint in the Flutter app:

1. Open `lib/main.dart`
2. Find the `_endpoint` variable (around line 71)
3. Update it with your IP address:

```dart
final String _endpoint = 'http://192.168.1.100:8000/classify';
```

### 5. Run the Flutter App

From the Flutter project directory:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 6. Test the Application

1. Open the app on your device
2. Tap "Select Image" to choose an image from your gallery
3. Wait for the analysis to complete
4. View the results showing whether the image is AI-generated or human-created

## API Endpoints

### POST `/classify`

Analyzes an uploaded image to determine if it's AI-generated or human-created.

**Request:**
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Body: Image file

**Response:**
```json
{
  "label": "hum" | "ai",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "allow": true,
  "scores": {
    "hum": 0.95,
    "ai": 0.05
  }
}
```

## Project Structure

```

├── lib/
│   └── main.dart          # Main Flutter application
├── pubspec.yaml           # Flutter dependencies
└── README.md             # This file

server.py                 # FastAPI backend server
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Error**: Ensure both devices are on the same network and the server is running
2. **Model Loading**: First run may take longer as the AI model downloads
3. **Image Format**: Ensure images are in supported formats (JPEG, PNG)

### Network Configuration

- **iOS Simulator**: Use `http://localhost:8000/classify`
- **Android Emulator**: Use `http://10.0.2.2:8000/classify`
- **Physical Devices**: Use your machine's local IP address

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **UI Changes**: Modify `lib/main.dart`
2. **Backend Logic**: Update `server.py`
3. **Dependencies**: Add to `pubspec.yaml` (Flutter) or install via pip (Python)

### Building for Production

```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release
```
